A log of experiences and thouughst of a random guy living in a random town in India during the 21 days CoVid-19 pandemic lockdown.

# Day 0
Today the Prime Minister of India at 8 p.m. announced a countrywide lock down for 21 days starting midnight 24th of March 2020. I thought of creating a log of the things happening to me and around me, hence the existence of this page. I may or may not look at this page after few months or years. But this is an experiment I am going to do. I am going to write it in an anonymous way and as open as possible. This time will be a testing time for me, my family and my countrymen.

# Day 1
As you might know that India is a populous nation and with skewed health sector. Skewed in the sense that urban people have access to very good but private hospitals and non-urban people dont have access to goo medical facilities. I am a bit worried about the people down the pyramid, those who dont have access to medical facilities. I think India needs to re-look its health sector. It has become an exponent of crony capitalism. Morever, we have too many daily wagers. Those who work on daily basis and use that money to survive. If many of those are not having any savings, how would they be able to survive? An rural-poor or daily wager is better positioned as compared to an urban daily-wager/poor. I hope people can help those in need. I will try to do so as well. Although I am not rich, but I do have a job and a few savings. Yesterday, I was told by my manager, if the impact of CoVid-19 is prolonged one of the order of greater than 6 months. There will be an impact on human resources. I hope our and the world governments are working on policies to reduce the impact. It is almost like a pseudo-world war. Where were are fighting the invisible. I hope my country doesn't crumble in this stressful situation. Today is the first day, so things have started off well. Some people might not be aware about this announcement, hence they were out. A policmen's lathi was waiting for them.

Okay, anyhow. I thought this twenty days was a nice thing to inculcate a habit. I am working on having a Yoga regime. I used to do yoga few years back, but the fast city life..sucked(time) life out of me. So I am working on 21 days yoga challenge. You may also start. I hope this may also give me inner physical strength to fight the virus.

I did not tell you, I am working from home as well. My work is not impacted by the shutdown. I am very well able to work till I have internet connection. I also heard that, if there is a lot of rumour mongering government may have to stop the internet. Let's hope that doesnt happen.

I am also doing a course online. This is an opporutnity to learn something as well.

Lastly, I am spending time with my parents. It the first time in last 12 years, that I would have spent these many days with them. BTW I left the city, right in time, as I assesses the situtation. ANd was back to my hometown, before the borders were closed. I and my wife were already working from home for last 10 days. And my wife even earlier, so I was sure I will not be exposed to infection. And I used my personal car to travel back to home town. It's a days drive.
