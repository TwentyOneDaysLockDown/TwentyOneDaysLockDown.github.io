# Twenty One Days Lockdown 
Log of experiences and thouught of a random guy living in a random town in India during the 21 days CoVid-19 pandemic lockdown.

# Day 0
Today the Prime Minister of India at 8 p.m. announced a countrywide lock down for 21 days starting midnight 24th of March 2020. I thought of creating a log of the things happening to me and around me, hence the existence of this page. I may or may not look at this page after few months or years. But this is an experiment I am going to do. I am going to write it in an anonymous way and as open as possible. This time will be a testing time for me, my family and my countrymen.
