# Day 0

Today the Prime Minister of India at 8 p.m. announced a countrywide lock down for 21 days starting midnight 24th of March 2020. I thought of creating a log of the things happening to me and around me, hence the existence of this page. I may or may not look at this page after a few months or years. But this is an experiment I am going to do. I am going to write it in an anonymous way and as open as possible. This time will be a testing time for me, my family and my countrymen.

# Day 1

As you might know that India is a populous nation and with the skewed health sector. Skewed in the sense that urban people have access to very good but private hospitals and non-urban people don't have access to good medical facilities or sometimes none at all. I am a bit worried about the people down the pyramid, those who don't have access to medical facilities. I think India needs to re-look its health sector. It has become an exponent of crony capitalism. Moreover, we have too many daily wagers. Those who work on a daily basis and use that money to survive. If many of those are not having any savings, how would they be able to survive? A rural-poor or daily wager is better positioned as compared to an urban daily-wager/poor. I hope people can help those in need. I will try to do so as well. Although I am not rich, I do have a job and a few savings. Yesterday, I was told by my manager, if the impact of CoVid-19 is prolonged one of the orders of greater than 6 months. There will be an impact on human resources. I hope our and the world governments are working on policies to reduce the impact. It is almost like a pseudo-world war. Where were are fighting the invisible. I hope my country doesn't crumble in this stressful situation. Today is the first day, so things have started off well. Some people might not be aware of this announcement, hence they were out. A policemen's lathi was waiting for them.

Okay, anyhow. I thought that twenty-day was a nice thing to inculcate a habit. I am working on having a Yoga regime. I used to do yoga few years back, but the fast city life..sucked(time) life out of me. So I am working on 21 days yoga challenge. You may also start. I hope this may also give me the inner physical strength to fight the virus.

I did not tell you, I am working from home as well. My work is not impacted by the shutdown. I am very well able to work till I have internet connection. I also heard that, if there is a lot of rumor mongering government may have to stop the internet. Let's hope that doesn't happen.

I am also doing a course online. This is an opportunity to learn something as well.

Lastly, I am spending time with my parents. It the first time in last 12 years, that I would have spent these many days with them. BTW I left the city, right in time, as I assesses the situation. And was back to my hometown, before the borders were closed. I and my wife were already working from home for the last 10 days. And my wife even earlier, so I was sure I will not be exposed to infection. And I used my personal car to travel back to home town. It's a days drive.

# Day 2

The day 2 started normally, woke up early in the morning did Yoga for an hour. The weather is sunny. To be true my work routine has not changed much because of the lock down. The other member of my team are outside India, and I have always been working remotely but sitting at the office. You can say my job doesn't require me to go to the office at all. And giving a remote working option always, with a need-based travel to the office might actually help the company. They won't have to pay for the building rent. Which is quite costly in a populous city of India.

This also makes me think that in the future I could like to work for a company that allows remote working, or I work as a consultant. The business model of cities, with inflated property prices, where you earn and then spend your money on rent or for an inflated property for years is really like shackles. I need to find a way to break these shackles. Do we need to be the frot runner in this rat race, or not be part of this race at all? I guess, I don't want to be a rat, would you?

My town observes a leniency of few hours during the this lock down period, during that time people can go and buy essentials. However, I feel some people are flouting this opportunity. They just go out for a walk. They feel they are invincible. But no one knows how one's body would behave when it is attacked by the COVID-19. India has about 700 cases now, and close to 12 deaths. I am sure we are doing very little testing. And many people might be just suffering through corona like the common flu, unnoticed.

There are reports that people are not able to get essentials. Well for a country like India, I think it is very hard. I also saw some videos where people are traveling in the trucks that bring essentials. They are mainly laborers/daily wagers. Those dint know what is coming. They do have internet these days, in their mobile. But usually, that is used for entertainment, not for knowledge or important information

There are few pros of this lockdown. I am hearing sounds of birds more often. Tomorrow I will take note of birds I see throught out the day. That would be an interesting activity. Overall, pollution levels have also reduced drastically. Things are cleaning up. Maybe this kind of detox was required. I hope after this pandemic govt. work put more emphasis on environment issues. We are also witnessing some impossible scenarios from environment purview. This stoppage in economic activity is showsing us what earh's atmosphere can be. May be its like the what we used to have 20-30 years ago. I think it will be nice to log the air pollution levels in addition to the covid stats. I will start doing that from tomorrow.

See you on Day 3!


# Day 3 and Day 4

Okay, I am merging two days. The last two days have been quite busy in household chores. In India we have a culture of having house maids to help in household chores. Since, the lockdown they are not coming because the public transport has been stopped. They come from nearby villages, work at different houses during the day and go back.

Let's do a stat check. The COVID cases have reached near 900. Also the air quality level is good = 48. This has never happened as far as I can recollect.

I also listed the birds I observed over the day.

- Kite
- Parrot
- Mynah
- Stone Pigeon
- Bulbul: Nightingale
- Black Sparrow , dont know its actual name.
- Crow :)
- A magpie look alike bird, it had a long tail
- White colored migratory birds, I need to check the migratory bird of this season.

The common sparrow, which was so abundant many years back.. is no where to be found. Their extinction coincides with few things: Use of unleaded oil, increase in traffic and mobile towers/signals. I dont know really which reason can be attributed to them. it could be increased amount of pesticides in farms..

In the next post I will add a more detials about these birds, with photographs.

It has been raining for past couple of days. Look at a bright sunny day in itself quite a nice feeling. My house has a balcony, and our favouite pass time is sitting in the balcony and relishing black tea also watching people goinn around. These days its mostly watching street dogs and monkeys. The street dogs are not able ot find food these days. My father tries to feed them. He usually does that even normally. The street dogs are like common pet. Many people of the street feeding them. And they have marked territories, steet, parked cars and scooters, street vendor's wagon, every nook and corner do the street.

Coming back to core issue. There were reports that the daily wagers started going back to UP and Bihar from Delhi. Many on foot, for hundreds of kms. Some got gagged at the border od Delhi and UP. They were thousands, and pushing each other. Social distancing?
The politicians are accusing each other. But who is going to suffer? You knoe the answer very well I think....

Okay see you tomorrow.


# Day 5

Stat Check
CoVid cases have approached 1000.
AQI: 72

The govt. has further reduced the lineancy duration. It is now 10:00 to 13:00. People have also got passes during this time for an un-interrupted movement, and like any situation, people having political contact get such I-Cards. However, it is quite less. There is some strictness. Suddenly, I see govt officials working more responsibly. India is known for very sickening bureaucracy.

Well, my morning started usually, with a Yoga session. One must not bath just after Yoga, there needs to be atleast 45 mins gap. Also one must also not eat just after Yoga. Again a gap of 45 mins. is recommended.

So there is Sun today after a gap of two days. Every thing is refulgent, green. This is the time when I take my scooter and roam around in near countryside. Not this time. With reduced levels of pollution, I am using these Sunny days to boost my Vitamin D naturally. There are some reports that Vitamin D improves immunity. So in some snese I am preparing myself for the infection. That might happen in coming few months. Yoga is also for the same. Some regular physical activity with sunshine vitamin will help improve my immunity.

Anyways, the movement of migrants has increased. To be true I am also a migrant. But right now I am talking about those people who dont have any much money. And with no public transport, they started walking kilometers bare foot. There were a couple of reports few of them died on road. This is really sad. What can I do at this time? What humans can do at this time?

I and my family had a discussion that we are going to do our bit. Help people in whatever way we can, while maintaining social distancing.

The roads are empty, they have become playground for monkeys, donkeys and cows. They are roaming around very freely. Like we humans used to ha ha..



I also spent sometime watching a movie named Parasite. It is on amazon prime video. It is an interesting movies and shows the grim reality of class divide. I had been to South Korea many years back when I was working with a Korean company. The people have a very hirearchichal way of working. One of the Korean manager's talked to me in a demeaning way, and was more like a military personnel. Then O got to know koreans have to do 2 years of military sevice compulsarily. And also them marry very late on an average. It takes almost 35 years for a person to reach a stage in life financially when can support a family. I also got to know from a Korean guy that they marry gals from China. Because mainting a Korean gal is difficult, also those gals dont marry early. I must say I don't know the exact reson as well. But this is a trend I know.

May be it is because of this hirearchichal culture the South Koreans have been able to contian the CoVID threat in time.

Okay I guess lot of banter now. I will report tomorrow. Over and out!

# Day 6

The covid cases have reached near 1050. And the AQI is 90. This shows that the economic activity is subtantially low.

This reminds me to tell you about the share market. The BSE-SENSEX which is an average index of top 30 well established companies, it was at 42K during the end of Feb, 2020. Then became 38K when the pandamic started reaching global markets, mainly NYSE. When the lock down was announced last week it became 26K and currently it is at 29K. The IMF head also said that we are going into a deep recession. The other day Mr. Trump also talked about an inevitable recession. It is rare of the rarest occassion when Mr. Trump talked sensibly, looks like his mental capabilities(inabilities) have been hijacked by the sensible scientists around him who are looking on how the pandemic is evolving. He later extended the lock down in the US, which was contrary to his whimsical locution earlier this week. Which he termed as a wish he had. 

On similar lines the PM of India also aplogised to the public for the unease that his decision has caused. Some of the events that have happened after the lockdown are catastrophic for daily wagers. Govt. is taking actions to help this but it is a bitter truth that our country doesnt have resources to handle this situation. Policemen have not been hired for many years, many posts are vacant, and they have been hiring private security companies to help them, for instance traffic management, and the people hired by these private companies are actually migrants. Govt. health facilities are in poor state. Only very few doctors join the govt. hospitals, most of them become consultants to super speciality hospitals. The concept of family physician is no longer existant. Many times I have met different doctors, but later I realized that it is important that I meet same doctor, I must have a family physician, but finding a reliable doctor is very difficult.

Once I checked ratings of a doctor online and went to meet him when I was sick. His fees was on the higher side. I went into his cabin after waiting for so long, I told him that I have cough, cold and fever. And he just started dictating medicine to his assistant doctor. he not even checked my pulse, my breathing or used stethoscope and that was really shocking. Anywyays, I did take the medicine and completed the course. It took me two weeks or so to get well. It was in the year of 2018. Later, I thought of writing a feedback online. I observed that there were few feedback that said similar things. Perhaps the popular website where I saw his rating earlier was moderated unlike the current one which was not moderated strictly. I never went to that doctor again. Since then , I am still searching for a sensible doctor, who is service oriented and not only having money making mentality. But this search has not returned me any good result till now. The online feedbacks seem to paid and moderated.

I have seen doctors, having two I-phones in hand, wearing super expensive watches, and fiddling on mobile while the patient speaks. Are they justifying there responsiblity? People directly going to specialists and not going to a physician first. Overall, the welfare system of medical facilities have failed in India. This is a real problem, in addition to proper education. That I will write about later some point of time.

So, coming back to market, there have been some reports that many people are defualting in China, a similar phenomenon will happen here. What will happen to the banks then? I have some savings in private banks, I hope my hard earned money is safe. The share price of the banks is going down. I need to understand what repercusion it will have on me or on a common man and be prepared for consequences.

Anyways, we must do whatever we can and stop worrying for things that we cant change at all. This is a fuzzy statement, when do we know how much should we try for something? On that note good bye for today.

# Day 7

Stats Check: Covid cases are now around 1350 and the AQI is at 53.

I feel a bit bad about writing stats for the covid cases, there have been some cases where kids in their teen age have died. Not in India atleast but outside. This is really sad..
One of my team mates who works in Germany also got infected recently. He is the first one to be infected whom I know personally. I wish a wuick recovery for him. I also got to know that Germany is handling the crisis very well. However, for his case at first the physician suggested a normal flu.

Okay back to India now, a bad news is that, India might see a spike in case counts in coming two weeks. One of the reason is that recently a religious congregation of 2000 people had couple of covid positive cases. And they might have infected these others. It was a 4-5 days long congregation. There were strict rules to not have these big congregations, and it was an irreponsible behaviour. Many of them have returned back t their places, spread across India. A couple of infected people died 2-3 days back. This was happening under the hood. Dont know how it went unnoticed form the eyes of officials. The blame game has started. But the reality is that, this is one of the visible instance which could have already spread to coommunity all over India. The other invisible cases are those, who travelled outside, were asymptomatic and traveled back to India to various place. Govt. claims its still Stage 2, however common sense of a common man says its already in Stage 3 and yet to explode. Coming 2-3 weeks will show the reality. I am going to say a cliche here " Its always gets worst before it gets better".

to be continued...


# Day 8 and Day 9

The covid active cases have reached 2300 approx, and aqi is 86. Looks like 70-90 is normal aqi in the region.

The rules have been made stricter in my locality, now none can use private vehicles during the lineancy period of 3 hours. One must walk.
The days are sunny and evenings are rainy. I happened to observe primary and secondry rainbow yesterday. Weather is very nice these days, as I write I can hear birds outside. I love this confinement.

Okay this reminds me that I wanted to add photographs of the birds I observed. I dont have a DSLR, taking photos of these birds with mobile camera was tough, the clarity was bad.

[Blue Whistling Thrush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whistling_thrush)
I mistook it has Koel. But I am sure I observed koel as well, because I heard the sounds of koel(cuckoo).

[Red-billied blue magpie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-billed_blue_magpie)
These don't come near to the houses. I see them across the river, near dense green area.

[Common Myna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_myna)

[Himalayan Bulbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayan_bulbul#/media/File:The_Himalayan_Bulbul.jpg)
Looks like some human got inspired from its hairstyle.

[Rock Dove](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Birds_of_Himachal_Pradesh#/media/File:A_pigeon_sitting_on_Idol_in_hindu_Temple.jpg)


[Parakeet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaty-headed_parakeet)

[Bar Headed Goose](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-30799436)
I think I observed birds very similar to these, they fly very high up. And it is a migratory bird.

[Himalayan Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_jungle_crow)

[Asian Koyal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_koel)

There are some more sounds I hear, but I havent seen those birds. I hope I will be able to see them.


# Day 10 and Day 11

The total reported covid active cases are now approx 3500 and and the aqi is 50.

The religious gatherring I talked about became the hot topic of discussion. Mojority of new cases are from that event. This also lead to vilifying of that religion across nation, the media played a great role of adding fuel to the fire. It was really a detrimental role of media. The race of viewership can make them do anything and this is a a heinous act. This can lead to riots..but since its curfew everywhere, it dint happen. Three guys from that gathering are from my town. They have been quarantined.

I have been less regular in updating the log and even for my daily yoga, the lathargy is taking on me..  ha ha.. Somtimes it's okay I guess! Some times doing nothing is also fun. Just watching time go by.

Today I re-lived my childhood days, watching birds go to their nests in the evening. They always go from right part of the town to the left part in the evening as a group. And they shine an the evening light of sun. The moon also started peeping out of the white clouds, those clouds became slightly red and murky because of evening light. The moevement of birds in the morning from left to right is unnoticable. But in the evening they fly as a group. That had been my childhood always. Sitting on the armrest of an archiach chair, where my granny would sit, doing some evening prayers. And I just looking towards sky. I never knew when all this went away... and I became part of city..where I rush to my home ar the clock strikes 6 pm. The more time I have been spending at my hometown, the more I am getting a craving to get back to this place as soon as possible. Alas! There is no vocation possible, until the remote working becomes a reality. Till then I will keep this longing alive underneath my bosom.. 
Playing badminton with my dad for sometime was fun, and then ludo with famliy. Eating evening snacks together, sipping a cup fo coffe in balcony with my parents, and gossip its really satisfying. It has been like stengthening family bonds. There has been an exodus from my town, many kids of my age.. or younger moved to cities to work, for career aspirations, the small town ecosystem could not provide vocations aligned to the education we happened to pursue. I am fortunate to have sepent these many days after so many years with parents. I noticed closely that my mother gets somewhat lethargic while doing household chores..time has really passed by..old age is showing its signs. Even my hairs are greying...

Anyways, let me just enjoy this time :)
