A log of experiences and thoughts of a random guy living in a random town in India during the 21 days CoVid-19 pandemic lockdown.

# Day 0

Today the Prime Minister of India at 8 p.m. announced a countrywide lock down for 21 days starting midnight 24th of March 2020. I thought of creating a log of the things happening to me and around me, hence the existence of this page. I may or may not look at this page after a few months or years. But this is an experiment I am going to do. I am going to write it in an anonymous way and as open as possible. This time will be a testing time for me, my family and my countrymen.

# Day 1

As you might know that India is a populous nation and with the skewed health sector. Skewed in the sense that urban people have access to very good but private hospitals and non-urban people don't have access to good medical facilities or sometimes none at all. I am a bit worried about the people down the pyramid, those who don't have access to medical facilities. I think India needs to re-look its health sector. It has become an exponent of crony capitalism. Moreover, we have too many daily wagers. Those who work on a daily basis and use that money to survive. If many of those are not having any savings, how would they be able to survive? A rural-poor or daily wager is better positioned as compared to an urban daily-wager/poor. I hope people can help those in need. I will try to do so as well. Although I am not rich, I do have a job and a few savings. Yesterday, I was told by my manager, if the impact of CoVid-19 is prolonged one of the orders of greater than 6 months. There will be an impact on human resources. I hope our and the world governments are working on policies to reduce the impact. It is almost like a pseudo-world war. Where were are fighting the invisible. I hope my country doesn't crumble in this stressful situation. Today is the first day, so things have started off well. Some people might not be aware of this announcement, hence they were out. A policemen's lathi was waiting for them.

Okay, anyhow. I thought that twenty-day was a nice thing to inculcate a habit. I am working on having a Yoga regime. I used to do yoga few years back, but the fast city life..sucked(time) life out of me. So I am working on 21 days yoga challenge. You may also start. I hope this may also give me the inner physical strength to fight the virus.

I did not tell you, I am working from home as well. My work is not impacted by the shutdown. I am very well able to work till I have internet connection. I also heard that, if there is a lot of rumor mongering government may have to stop the internet. Let's hope that doesn't happen.

I am also doing a course online. This is an opportunity to learn something as well.

Lastly, I am spending time with my parents. It the first time in last 12 years, that I would have spent these many days with them. BTW I left the city, right in time, as I assesses the situation. And was back to my hometown, before the borders were closed. I and my wife were already working from home for the last 10 days. And my wife even earlier, so I was sure I will not be exposed to infection. And I used my personal car to travel back to home town. It's a days drive.

# Day 2

The day 2 started normally, woke up early in the morning did Yoga for an hour. The weather is sunny. To be true my work routine has not changed much because of the lock down. The other member of my team are outside India, and I have always been working remotely but sitting at the office. You can say my job doesn't require me to go to the office at all. And giving a remote working option always, with a need-based travel to the office might actually help the company. They won't have to pay for the building rent. Which is quite costly in a populous city of India.

This also makes me think that in the future I could like to work for a company that allows remote working, or I work as a consultant. The business model of cities, with inflated property prices, where you earn and then spend your money on rent or for an inflated property for years is really like shackles. I need to find a way to break these shackles. Do we need to be the frot runner in this rat race, or not be part of this race at all? I guess, I don't want to be a rat, would you?

My town observes a leniency of few hours during the this lock down period, during that time people can go and buy essentials. However, I feel some people are flouting this opportunity. They just go out for a walk. They feel they are invincible. But no one knows how one's body would behave when it is attacked by the COVID-19. India has about 700 cases now, and close to 12 deaths. I am sure we are doing very little testing. And many people might be just suffering through corona like the common flu, unnoticed.

There are reports that people are not able to get essentials. Well for a country like India, I think it is very hard. I also saw some videos where people are traveling in the trucks that bring essentials. They are mainly laborers/daily wagers. Those dint know what is coming. They do have internet these days, in their mobile. But usually, that is used for entertainment, not for knowledge or important information

There are few pros of this lockdown. I am hearing sounds of birds more often. Tomorrow I will take note of birds I see throught out the day. That would be an interesting activity. Overall, pollution levels have also reduced drastically. Things are cleaning up. Maybe this kind of detox was required. I hope after this pandemic govt. work put more emphasis on environment issues. We are also witnessing some impossible scenarios from environment purview. This stoppage in economic activity is showsing us what earh's atmosphere can be. May be its like the what we used to have 20-30 years ago. I think it will be nice to log the air pollution levels in addition to the covid stats. I will start doing that from tomorrow.

See you on Day 3!


# Day 3 and Day 4

Okay, I am merging two days. The last two days have been quite busy in household chores. In India we have a culture of having house maids to help in household chores. Since, the lockdown they are not coming because the public transport has been stopped. They come from nearby villages, work at different houses during the day and go back.

Let's do a stat check. The COVID cases have reached near 900. Also the air quality level is good = 48. This has never happened as far as I can recollect.

I also listed the birds I observed over the day.

- Kite
- Parrot
- Mynah
- Stone Pigeon
- Bulbul: Nightingale
- Black Sparrow , dont know its actual name.
- Crow :)
- A magpie look alike bird, it had a long tail
- White colored migratory birds, I need to check the migratory bird of this season.

The common sparrow, which was so abundant many years back.. is no where to be found. Their extinction coincides with few things: Use of unleaded oil, increase in traffic and mobile towers/signals. I dont know really which reason can be attributed to them. it could be increased amount of pesticides in farms..

In the next post I will add a more detials about these birds, with photographs.

It has been raining for past couple of days. Look at a bright sunny day in itself quite a nice feeling. My house has a balcony, and our favouite pass time is sitting in the balcony and relishing black tea also watching people goinn around. These days its mostly watching street dogs and monkeys. The street dogs are not able ot find food these days. My father tries to feed them. He usually does that even normally. The street dogs are like common pet. Many people of the street feeding them. And they have marked territories, steet, parked cars and scooters, street vendor's wagon, every nook and corner do the street.

Coming back to core issue. There were reports that the daily wagers started going back to UP and Bihar from Delhi. Many on foot, for hundreds of kms. Some got gagged at the border od Delhi and UP. They were thousands, and pushing each other. Social distancing?
The politicians are accusing each other. But who is going to suffer? You knoe the answer very well I think....

Okay see you tomorrow.
